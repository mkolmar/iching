# I Ching
This I Ching hexagram generator was created by photomattmills, around 2011, with some improvements since. This version is updated by Mark Kolmar. Changing lines are displayed, along with the changed hexagram.

## Usage
The script bin/iching can be run from the command line. The index of hexagrams and some methods in hexagram-generation code may be of interest.

The probabilites of the three-coin oracle are used by default. Yarrow stalk oracle can also be used, but no command-line flag is available at the moment.
